## Platform for recording and viewing video based incremented scorekeeping ('clicking').

#### This is a simple python interface using 'ttk' to record button presses in the contexts of tournament videos (namely, the TE portion of yoyo freestyles). 

#### You can compile this file or just launch it via cli with 'python3 ycount.py'

#### Since there is a timepoint saved when you click, it is ideal to start the recording/timer at the beginning of the freestyle (when the music starts). 'y' is to start clicking, 'p' is to pause the clicking, and 'q' is to reset.
#### You can click using the keyboard with 'f' and 'd' or 'k' and 'j' for positive or negative points, respectively. 

#### After including metadata of the judge name and video, you can save this as a csv file for future playback and analysis.
